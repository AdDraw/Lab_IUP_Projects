This code was made as the 8th assignment to do in the IUP class.

This project's purpose is to properly read information from a keyboard which uses a PS/2 interface.
Read codes must be encoded in a way to present them on a 4-digit hexadecimal display.
Hexadecimal display can only display a hexadecimal number representation therefore only a group of keyboard keys needs to be 
read (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,a,b,c,d,e,f). In case that any other key was pressed the display will be cleared.

This project consists of submodules.

This project is intended for studying only.
Made to comply with a Digilent Spartan-3 development board with a Spartan-3 3S200 FT256-4 FPGA.
