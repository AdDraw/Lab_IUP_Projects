This code was made as the 9th assignment to do in the IUP class.

This project was made to control a RS232 port. 
Consisting of both a receiver and a transmitter it is capable of adding 20h to an incoming character(ASCII)
and transmitting it back to the computer.

Works with a 9600 BaudRate, 8bit data format, no Parity bit, one Stop bit and with no Hardware Flow Control.
Uses a 50MHz clock with an asynchronous global reset.

This project is intended for studying only.
Made to comply with a Digilent Spartan-3 development board with a Spartan-3 3S200 FT256-4 FPGA.
