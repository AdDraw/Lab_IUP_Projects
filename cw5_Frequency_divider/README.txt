This code was made as a 5th assignment to do in the IUP class.

It can divide the frequency using a configurable integer.
Was made to work with a clock of 50MHz and works with both even and odd integers.
For odd numbers the ratio of the clock will differ from 50%.

By no means it is a viable and a secure divider for the use in complex projects.

This project is intended for studying only.
Made to comply with a SPARTAN 3 FPGA by Xilinx.
